Welcome to the source code of my personal website!

This website is written partially in a programming language I created named [Eco](https://github.com/Francessco121/eco)! Eco utilizes the build system from the [Dart programming language](https://dartlang.org/). So, although this website (currently) does not contain any Dart code, it can take advantage of compilers that support Dart's build system, such as Eco and Sass.
